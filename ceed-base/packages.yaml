# This file is part of CEED, a collection of benchmarks, miniapps, software
# libraries and APIs for efficient high-order finite element and spectral
# element discretizations for exascale applications. For more information and
# source code availability see http://github.com/ceed.
#
# The CEED research is supported by the Exascale Computing Project 17-SC-20-SC,
# a collaborative effort of two U.S. Department of Energy organizations (Office
# of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration) responsible for
# the planning and preparation of a capable exascale ecosystem, including
# software, applications, hardware, advanced system engineering and early
# testbed platforms, in support of the nation's exascale computing imperative.
#
# By default, the Spack-based CEED installation will build all required packages
# from scratch, which can take a long time. The file ~/.spack/packages.yaml, or
# ~/.spack/<platform>/packages.yaml allows you to list packages already
# installed on your system for Spack to use instead of compiling them itself.
#
# This is an example packages.yaml file for Ubuntu 19.10 using GCC and other
# development packages via "apt install" and with MPICH installed separately (as
# needed to use containerized HPC environments like Shifter and Singularity).
# You can use
#
#    docker pull jedbrown/ceed-base
#
# to get a build environment with this packages.yaml that is ready for
# "spack install ceed".
